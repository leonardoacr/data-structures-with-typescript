# Data Structure With TypeScript (100% Coverage)

This repository is dedicated to hold my studies on data structure with TypeScript, with the added assurance of extensive unit test coverage reaching 100%.

## Overview

Understanding data structures is crucial for building efficient and scalable software. That is why I decided to review concepts of DS and create the main structures with the best of TypeScript. To ensure the reliability of the implemented structures, each class is extensively covered with unit tests using `Jest`.

Additionally, every data structure comes with its own markdown file containing a basic explanation of the target structure, complemented by practical examples.
