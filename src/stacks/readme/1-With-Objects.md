# Stack With Objects

Another way to implement a **stack** structure in JavaScript is using an object. To do this, we need to manually implement some of the built-in array functions, such as the toString() method. Let's start by defining the object structure as follows:

```tsx
class Stack implements StackMethodsObject {
	constructor() {
		this.count = 0;
		this.items = {};
}
```

Where the interface ‘StackMethodsObject’ extends the Array one:

```tsx
export interface StackMethodsObject extends StackMethodsArray {
  toString(): string[];
}
```

In conclusion, stacks are a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) method used to track and manage processes. Stacks provide a structured approach to managing data, where the last item added is the first one to be removed. This data structure is widely used in various applications, such as operating systems, programming languages, and data processing systems. By implementing stacks, organizations can effectively manage and organize their processes, ensuring efficient execution and resource utilization. Additionally, stacks offer a simple and intuitive way to track the flow of data and operations, making them an essential tool in the field of computer science.
